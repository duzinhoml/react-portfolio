            <p>My name is Mathew Lopez, and I’m currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science while participating in an intensive coding bootcamp 
            to refine my skills. I’m passionate about leveraging technology to make a positive impact, whether by helping others solve problems or creating 
            solutions that inspire. This field excites me because it combines creativity, logic, and the opportunity to continuously learn and grow.<br/><br/>

            I’ve always been motivated by the idea of using coding as a tool to empower others and bring meaningful change to the world. Whether it’s through 
            developing innovative applications or sharing my journey to inspire future coders, I am committed to making a difference. I’m thrilled to be part of 
            this dynamic and ever-evolving industry and can’t wait to see what the future holds for my career.<br/><br/>

            Feel free to explore my work and see what I’m currently creating!</p>
